Dom
DOM stand for data object model
it is a tree like stucture 
the tree structure is made up of nodes and each node is a html element
html element may be html tags just like the heading ,paragraph  ,attribute 
dom is used to represent interactive and dynamic content



access the html  element using the dom 

1: get  the html element bye id  name

let text = document.getElementById  ("id")
  
  we can also change the html element attribute styles using innerHTML keyword

2: get element by class name

let text = document.getElementByClassName ("class")

class give us the array of classes that can be access by giving indexes
so we can change the class attribute by specifying the index of the class
